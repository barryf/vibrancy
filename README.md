# Vibrancy

Vibrancy is a Headless CMS and [Micropub](https://micropub.net/) endpoint that acts as the backend to my personal website. 

It's built using the [Architect](https://arc.codes/) serverless framework in Node.js and must be deployed to AWS.

See the separate [barryfrost](https://github.com/barryf/barryfrost) project for the frontend of [barryfrost.com](https://barryfrost.com/) which uses Vibrancy as its backend.

## Status

This project is currently under active development and should be considered highly experimental and likely to change at any time. You're free to fork and hack on it but its primary purpose is to evolve based on my needs. Use at your own risk!
